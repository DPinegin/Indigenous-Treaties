        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>
          Treaty One was the first signed treaty created in Canada. It is also
          <span>the first numbered treaty</span>. What makes Treaty One
          different from other Treaties is the fact that both Treaty One and
          Treaty Two had fewer clauses than the treaties that would follow.

            understanding.

          In addition, they provide guidelines on how Europeans can use the
          traditional land that Indigenous Peoples have occupied. They also
          provide documents with Indigenous rights as written in the treaties.
